          <p>The vast park surrounding the summer residence of the last Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, is
            where Varsovians like to go for longer walks. The park is home to a winter garden, an amphitheatre, and even
            a Chinese garden. The biggest attraction, however, is the park’s permanent residents: the squirrels and
            peacocks. Another site worth seeing is the classicistic Palace on the Isle with its enchanting interior
            design and gallery of paintings.</p>
          <p>The park is famous for its Chopin concerts, which take place from mid-May to the end of September every
            Sunday at noon and 4 pm. Come lounge on the grass and enjoy the music.</p>

          <p>The Royal Route connects three former residences of Polish rulers: Royal Castle, Royal Łazienki and Wilanów
            Palace. It is the city’s most famous route. Among the buildings lining the streets Krakowskie Przedmieście
            and Nowy Świat are the Presidential Palace, the Warsaw University campus, as well as beautiful churches and
            townhouses. The Route continues along the elegant and green Aleje Ujazdowskie, with embassies and ministries
            situated along the way. The historical route ends at Wilanów Palace. The Route is not to be missed in the
            wintertime when it is illuminated with thousands of lights as part of the Great Illumination.</p>

          <p>A UNESCO world heritage site, the Old Town charms with its colourful townhouses and the exceptional
            atmosphere of its narrow streets. When in the Old Town Market Square, you will meet a mermaid – the official
            symbol of the city. Don’t forget to see the Barbican, stop by the bell on Kanonia Street, and walk along the
            old city walls. You should also visit the Royal Castle. Apart from the royal apartments, the old seat of
            Polish rulers also houses an art collection with paintings by Rembrandt and Bernardo Bellotto, also known as
            Canaletto.</p>

            alt="Museum of King Jan III’s Palace at Wilanów">
          <p>Wilanów Palace is a true pearl of Baroque architecture in Warsaw. Learn about King Jan III Sobieski, who
            successfully fended off the Turks in the battle of Vienna and who lived in Wilanów with his beloved
            Marysieńka. Take a walk in the park and tour the palace interiors; see the portrait gallery and listen to
            stories of great romances. The building and the park have both kept their original form, despite the
            partition, war, and occupation. Wilanów Palace is a must-see when visiting Warsaw. In the wintertime, the
            venue, illuminated with thousands of lamps, transforms into the Royal Garden of Lights.</p>
