    "description": "<p>Wilanów Palace is a true pearl of Baroque architecture in Warsaw. Learn about King Jan III Sobieski, who successfully fended off the Turks in the battle of Vienna and who lived in Wilanów with his beloved Marysieńka. Take a walk in the park and tour the palace interiors; see the portrait gallery and listen to stories of great romances. The building and the park have both kept their original form, despite the partition, war, and occupation. Wilanów Palace is a must-see when visiting Warsaw. In the wintertime, the venue, illuminated with thousands of lamps, transforms into the Royal Garden of Lights.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The vast park surrounding the summer residence of the last Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, is where Varsovians like to go for longer walks. The park is home to a winter garden, an amphitheatre, and even a Chinese garden. The biggest attraction, however, is the park’s permanent residents: the squirrels and peacocks. Another site worth seeing is the classicistic Palace on the Isle with its enchanting interior design and gallery of paintings.</p><p>The park is famous for its Chopin concerts, which take place from mid-May to the end of September every Sunday at noon and 4 pm. Come lounge on the grass and enjoy the music.</p>"
